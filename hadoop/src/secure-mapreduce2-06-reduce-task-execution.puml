  note over C,DN #green: QUESTION Are map and reduce tasks run in different ACs?

'1
AM->RM: allocateResources\n [RPC:SASL(am-kp,rm-kp)]\n ( rt-container-req )\n : rt-container-res{}

'2
AM->NM: launchContainer\n [RPC:SASL(am-kp,rm-kp)]\n ( rt-container-res, serialized-secrets )

  create AC

'3
NM->AC: exec\n [as ?]\n ()
  note right: TODO

  activate AC

  note over C,DN #green: QUESTION: Does the reduce AC extract files from HDFS too?
'4
AC->FS: extractJobFiles?
  note right: e.g. Job JAR file.  TODO

  create T

'5
AC->T: exec\n [as c]\n ()
  note right #orange: Reduce Task

  activate T

note over C,DN #green: Does this use the shuffle-tkn or shuffle-sk?

'6
T->NM: readShuffleData\n[HTTP:???(shuffle-tkn)?]\n( ? )\n: shuffle-data
'MR ShuffleService service running in the node manager.  Has the shuffle service has the shuffle secret.
'Task talked to NM (shuffle-service) to get shuffle data.
'How does the shuffle service get the shuffle token.

T->T: reduce\n ( shuffle-data )\n : result-data

'8
T->NN: writeFile\n [RPC:SASL(c-nn-dt,nn)]\n ( result-file )\n : blk-id, blk-loc, blk-tkn
  note right: Need to identify where c-deleg-tkn\ncame from and when it was refreshed.

'9
T->DN: writeBlock\n [DTP(blk-tkn)]\n ( blk-id )\n : result-blk-data
