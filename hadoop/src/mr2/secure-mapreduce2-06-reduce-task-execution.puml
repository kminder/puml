note over C,DN #green: Q1 Are map and reduce tasks run in different ACs?

'1
AM->RM: <b>allocateResources\n [RPC:SASL(am-kp,rm-kp)]\n ( rt-container-req )\n : rt-container-res{}

  note right: TODO

  activate AC

note over C,DN #green: Q2: Does the reduce AC extract files from HDFS too?

AC->FS: <b>extractJobFiles</b>?
  note right: e.g. Job JAR file.  TODO

  create T

AC->T: <b>exec\n [as c]\n ()
  note right #orange: Reduce Task

  activate T

note over C,DN #green: Q3: Does this use the shfl-tkn or shfl-mk?

'MR ShuffleHanlder service running in the NodeManager.  Has the shuffle handler service has the shuffle secret.
'Task talked to NM/ShuffleServcie to get shfl-data.
'How does the shuffle service get the shfl-tkn.
